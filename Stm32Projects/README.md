Clone the Repository with Sparse Checkout Enabled:

    Open a terminal and clone the repository with the --no-checkout option:

    git clone --no-checkout <repository-url>

    Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

Navigate to the Repository Folder:

cd <repository-name>

Enable Sparse Checkout:

    Configure the repository to use sparse checkout:

    git sparse-checkout init

Specify the Paths You Want to Work With:

    Add the specific folder or file paths you want to include. For example:

    git sparse-checkout set examples/ your-current-project/

    This will ensure only the examples folder and the your-current-project folder are checked out.

Pull the Specified Files:

    Pull the content of the specified paths:

    git pull origin main

    Replace main with the branch you are working on if it's different.

Add Your Files:

    Navigate to the desired folder or path in your local sparse-checkout repo and add your project files:

cp /path/to/your/project/* your-current-project/

Stage the changes:

git add your-current-project/

Commit the changes:

git commit -m "Add working project files"

Push the changes back to the repository:

        git push origin main

Key Benefits of Sparse Checkout:

    Efficiency: You only download what you need, saving disk space and time.
    Focus: Keeps your working directory clean and manageable.

If you want to add multiple active projects while keeping examples untouched, just include their respective paths in the sparse-checkout list.
